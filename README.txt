This project is a simple demo from lighthouse3D.com on OpenGL framebuffer objects.

It uses VSL, also from lighthouse3D, which in turn uses the following third party libs:

- Assimp
- DevIL
- FreeGlut
- tinyXML 

For your convinience the headers, libs and dlls of all these libs have been added to this project. Licenses for all third party libs can be found in folder framebufferobject/licenses.

The project also includes a model courtesy of Viewpoint Animation Engineering. Please see the OBJ file for the usage agreement.

The rest belongs to lighthouse3D, and it  is released under the zlib license:
