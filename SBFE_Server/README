This is a modification of my assignment 1 code.

The server side runs the teacher application - it waits for incoming connections (students)
  and makes a data handler for each student.  It then prints into the command window the options
  that the user has for sending to the students.
  
The client side code runs the student application - it prints the options for the students 
  to send to the teacher into the command window.
  
A student must first register before doing anything else.  A teacher must have registered students
  before they can send anything.  A homework must be assigned by the teacher before it can be 
  submitted by the registered students.  It must also be assigned before the students can ask
  questions about it.  A question about an assigned homework must be asked before the teacher 
  can reply to the question.  
  
For the applications to receive data, they must exit their blocking console input commands.  This
  is done by entering the exit command to receive data.

Make the project files using the same mwc.pl arguments. (-type vc10)

usage:

* server.exe:
  * no arguments
  * prints port number
  * Periodically prints options commands
* client.exe:
  * arguments : <server hostname> <server port num>
  * Periodically prints options commands
